# Recurssion-The-Tower-Of-Hanoi-Problem

freeCodeCamp Practice Project.


Scientific Computing with Python.



Recursion is a programming approach that allows you to solve complicated computational problems with just a little code.

In this project, you'll start with a loop-based approach to solving the tower of Hanoi mathematical puzzle. Then you'll learn how to implement a recursive solution.
